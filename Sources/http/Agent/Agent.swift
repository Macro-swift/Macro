 * This eventually should also support Async HTTP Client and allow the framework
 * consumer to select the Agent backend.
 * The switching could be done by either making `Agent` a function, or by
 * creating a `Agent` class with distinct backends.
 *
 * For AHC we might want to tie `globalAgent` to an eventloop (i.e. thread).
